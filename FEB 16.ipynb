    "1) A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that enables efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of the data. It provides a mechanism to store and retrieve large amounts of information, typically with the goal of supporting various applications and data-driven operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, querying languages, and design philosophies:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "- SQL databases are based on the relational model and use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.\n",
    "- They organize data into tables with predefined schemas, where each row represents a record, and columns represent attributes of the record.\n",
    "- SQL databases enforce strict data integrity and provide powerful querying capabilities through SQL, which supports complex joins, aggregations, and transactions.\n",
    "- Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are designed to handle large-scale, unstructured, or semi-structured data and provide flexibility and scalability.\n",
    "- They don't rely on a fixed schema and can store data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columnar structures.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases offer high scalability and performance by employing distributed architectures and horizontal scaling across multiple servers or clusters.\n",
    "- They provide flexible data models and typically have their own query languages or APIs for data access and manipulation.\n",
    "- Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "1. Data Model: SQL databases use a rigid, predefined schema with structured tables, while NoSQL databases offer schema flexibility and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as a standard query language, which is powerful and supports complex queries and joins. NoSQL databases have their own query languages or APIs specific to their data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: SQL databases traditionally scale vertically by adding more resources to a single server. NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, distributing data across multiple servers or clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties and provide strong data consistency. NoSQL databases often sacrifice strong consistency for scalability and may provide eventual consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases: SQL databases are suitable for applications with structured data, complex relationships, and transactions, such as financial systems or e-commerce platforms. NoSQL databases excel in handling large amounts of unstructured or rapidly changing data, making them well-suited for web applications, real-time analytics, and content management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, complexity of relationships, consistency needs, and the specific use case of the application."

    "2) DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manipulate the structure of a database schema. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations and examples of commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Creating a table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "       id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove an existing database object from the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Dropping the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It can add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example 1: Adding a new column named \"department\" to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "   ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example 2: Modifying the data type of the \"salary\" column in the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "   ALTER COLUMN salary INT;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact. Unlike the DELETE statement, which removes rows one by one, TRUNCATE is more efficient for large data deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Truncating the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These DDL statements are essential for managing the structure of a database and its objects. They allow you to create new tables, modify existing structures, drop unnecessary objects, and efficiently delete data. DDL statements are typically executed by database administrators or developers responsible for the database schema design and maintenance."

    "3) DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate data within a database. DML statements are used to insert, update, and delete data stored in tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations and examples of commonly used DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to insert new data into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Inserting a new row into the \"Employees\" table with specific values for the columns.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   INSERT INTO Employees (id, name, salary)\n",
    "   VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Updating the salary of an employee in the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   UPDATE Employees\n",
    "   SET salary = 55000\n",
    "   WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove data from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Deleting a row from the \"Employees\" table based on a condition.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "   WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the INSERT example, a new row is inserted into the \"Employees\" table with specific values for the columns. The VALUES clause specifies the values to be inserted for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the UPDATE example, the salary of an employee is updated to a new value. The SET clause specifies the column to be updated and the new value, while the WHERE clause defines the condition to identify the specific row(s) to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the DELETE example, a row is deleted from the \"Employees\" table based on a condition specified in the WHERE clause. Only the rows that satisfy the condition will be removed from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DML statements are essential for manipulating data within a database. They allow you to insert new records, update existing values, and delete unnecessary data. DML statements are typically executed by applications or users to interact with the database and perform data-related operations."

    "4) DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve data from a database. DQL statements are primarily focused on querying and retrieving data from one or more tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT, which allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified criteria. Here's an explanation and an example of the SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified conditions. It allows you to specify the columns to be retrieved, filter rows using conditions, join multiple tables, perform aggregations, and sort the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Retrieving employee details from the \"Employees\" table who have a salary greater than 50000.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT id, name, salary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE salary > 50000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the SELECT statement retrieves the values of the \"id\", \"name\", and \"salary\" columns from the \"Employees\" table. The WHERE clause specifies the condition \"salary > 50000\" to filter the rows and retrieve only those employees whose salary is greater than 50000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the SELECT statement is a result set, which is a table-like structure containing the selected columns and rows that satisfy the specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further enhance the SELECT statement with additional clauses such as JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY to perform more complex queries, data aggregations, and sorting operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT statements are fundamental for retrieving data from databases, and they form the backbone of querying and extracting meaningful information from the stored data. They provide a flexible and powerful means of extracting specific data subsets and performing data analysis within a database system."

    "5) Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It provides a way to enforce data integrity and ensure that each record in the table is uniquely identifiable. Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: A primary key must have a unique value for each row in the table. No two rows can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-nullability: A primary key cannot have a null (empty) value. Each row must have a valid value for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Uniqueness Constraint: The database system automatically enforces the uniqueness constraint on the primary key column(s), preventing duplicate or null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing: A primary key is typically indexed, which allows for efficient retrieval and searching based on the primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Relationship Establishment: A primary key is often used to establish relationships with other tables, such as through foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link or a relationship between two tables, defining a dependency between them. Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relationship Establishment: A foreign key in one table refers to the primary key of another table, creating a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Referential Integrity: A foreign key ensures referential integrity by enforcing that the values in the foreign key column(s) must match an existing primary key value in the referenced table or be null.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Relationship Types: Foreign keys can establish different types of relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, depending on how they are defined and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cascading Actions: Foreign keys can have cascading actions, such as ON DELETE CASCADE or ON UPDATE CASCADE, which specify what happens to dependent records when the referenced primary key is modified or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Query Joins: Foreign keys are commonly used in query joins to retrieve related data from multiple tables based on the defined relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign keys help maintain data integrity, enforce relationships between tables, and enable efficient querying and retrieval of related data. They play a crucial role in establishing and maintaining the integrity and consistency of the database relationships."

    "6) To connect MySQL to Python, you can use the `mysql-connector-python` library. Make sure you have the library installed before running the code. Here's an example of how to connect to MySQL and execute a query using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection\n",
    "connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"your_username\",\n",
    "    password=\"your_password\",\n",
    "    database=\"your_database\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create cursor\n",
    "cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute query\n",
    "query = \"SELECT * FROM your_table\"\n",
    "cursor.execute(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch and print the result\n",
    "result = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in result:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of `cursor()` and `execute()` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `cursor()` method:\n",
    "   - The `cursor()` method is called on the database connection object to create a cursor object.\n",
    "   - The cursor is a control structure that allows you to execute SQL statements and fetch results.\n",
    "   - The cursor acts as a handle or pointer to the result set of a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `execute()` method:\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method is called on the cursor object to execute an SQL query or statement.\n",
    "   - It takes the SQL query as a parameter and executes it on the connected database.\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method can handle both parameterized queries and non-parameterized queries.\n",
    "   - For parameterized queries, you can pass a tuple or dictionary as a second parameter to provide values for the placeholders in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, we first establish a connection to the MySQL database by providing the necessary credentials (host, user, password, and database). Then, we create a cursor object using the `cursor()` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we execute an SQL query using the `execute()` method. In this example, we execute a SELECT query to fetch all rows from a table. \n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the query, we can retrieve the result using methods like `fetchall()` or `fetchone()`. In the code, we use `fetchall()` to fetch all rows returned by the query. We then iterate over the result set and print each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we close the cursor and connection using the `close()` method to release the resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to properly close the cursor and connection after you are done with your database operations to free up resources and maintain good database connection management practices."

    "7) In a standard SQL query, the order of execution of the clauses is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FROM: Specifies the tables from which the data will be retrieved. This clause identifies the source tables or views involved in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. WHERE: Filters the rows based on specified conditions. The WHERE clause specifies the criteria that must be met for a row to be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GROUP BY: Groups the rows into subsets based on specified columns. This clause is used in combination with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., to perform calculations on each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. HAVING: Filters the grouped rows based on specified conditions. The HAVING clause is used to apply filtering conditions to the groups created by the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. SELECT: Specifies the columns to be retrieved from the tables. The SELECT clause is used to define the desired output columns and can include expressions, aliases, and aggregate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on specified columns or expressions. The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify the sorting order (ascending or descending) for the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. LIMIT/OFFSET: Restricts the number of rows returned or skips a specified number of rows. These clauses are optional and depend on the specific database system you are using.\n"
