    "### 2) The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world, and restricting access to its internal state only through a public interface. In other words, it involves bundling data and methods together in a single unit (a class) and controlling access to that unit from outside the class. Encapsulation helps to protect the integrity of an object's data and ensure that it is only modified in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. This promotes code reuse and saves time by allowing the creation of new classes that are similar to existing ones. The existing class is called the parent or base class, while the new class is called the child or derived class. Inheritance is useful for creating more specialized classes that inherit common properties and behaviors from a more general parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. This can be achieved in different ways, such as through method overloading or method overriding. Method overloading involves defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, while method overriding involves redefining a method in a child class that was already defined in the parent class. Polymorphism allows for more flexible and dynamic code that can handle a variety of different inputs and scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves focusing on essential features of an object while ignoring less important or irrelevant details. This can be achieved by defining an abstract class or interface that provides a general structure or blueprint for a group of related classes. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, but can be subclassed to create more specific classes. Abstraction helps to simplify complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components.\n",
    "By using these four pillars of OOP, developers can create more modular, reusable, and flexible code that can better model real-world objects and systems."
