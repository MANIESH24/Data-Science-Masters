    "#### 1) Certainly! Here's an example of a `Vehicle` class in Python with an `__init__` method that initializes instance variables for the name of the vehicle, maximum speed, and average speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle, max_speed, average_speed):\n",
    "        self.name_of_vehicle = name_of_vehicle\n",
    "        self.max_speed = max_speed\n",
    "        self.average_speed = average_speed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Vehicle` class is defined with an `__init__` method. The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes that gets called automatically when an object is created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method takes four parameters: `self` (which refers to the instance being created) and the three instance variables `name_of_vehicle`, `max_speed`, and `average_speed`. Within the `__init__` method, we assign the provided values to the corresponding instance variables using the `self` keyword.\n",

    "print(car.name_of_vehicle)  # Output: Car\n",

    "print(car.average_speed)    # Output: 60\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create an instance of the `Vehicle` class called `car` with the name \"Car\", maximum speed of 200, and average speed of 60. We can then access the instance variables of `car` using dot notation (`car.name_of_vehicle`, `car.max_speed`, `car.average_speed`) to retrieve their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `Vehicle` class serves as a blueprint for creating vehicle objects, and the `__init__` method initializes the object's attributes with the provided values."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "car = Car(\"Car\", 200, 60)\n",
    "print(car.seating_capacity(5))  # Output: The Car has a seating capacity of 5 passengers.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create an instance of the `Car` class called `car` with the name \"Car\", maximum speed of 200, and average speed of 60.

The method returns a string indicating the name of the vehicle and its seating capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By inheriting from the `Vehicle` class, the `Car` class has access to the `name_of_vehicle` attribute defined in the parent class. This allows the `seating_capacity` method to provide the name of the vehicle when returning the seating capacity information."

    "#### 3)Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. It allows a subclass to inherit from multiple base classes, incorporating their functionality into the derived class.\n",

    "airplane = Airplane(\"Airplane\")\n",
    "airplane.drive()\n",
    "airplane.fly()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have three classes: `Vehicle`, `Flying`, and `Car`. `Vehicle` is a base class with a `drive()` method, `Flying` is another base class with a `fly()` method, and `Car` is a derived class that inherits from `Vehicle`. Additionally, we have the `Airplane` class, which demonstrates multiple inheritance by inheriting from both `Vehicle` and `Flying` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Vehicle` class has an `__init__()` method and a `drive()` method to simulate driving a vehicle. The `Flying` class has a `fly()` method to simulate flying. The `Car` class inherits from `Vehicle`, and the `Airplane` class inherits from both `Vehicle` and `Flying`.\n",

The `airplane.drive()` statement also calls the `drive()` method inherited from the `Vehicle` class. Moreover, the `airplane.fly()` statement calls the `fly()` method inherited from the `Flying` class.\n",

    "#### 4) In Python, getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the values of private or protected attributes of a class. They provide controlled access to the attributes and allow the implementation of additional logic, such as data validation or encapsulation.\n",

    "Here's an example of a class with getter and setter methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",

    "        self._name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self._name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "        self._name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the Person class\n",

    "\n",
    "# Get the updated value of the name attribute\n",
    "print(person.get_name())  # Output: Jane\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a `Person` class with a private attribute `_name` (denoted by a single underscore). The class provides getter and setter methods, `get_name()` and `set_name()`, respectively, to access and modify the value of the `_name` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_name()` method simply returns the value of the `_name` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `set_name()` method takes a `name` argument and sets the value of the `_name` attribute to the provided value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create an instance of the `Person` class called `person` and initialize it with the name \"John\". We then use the getter method `get_name()` to retrieve the value of the `_name` attribute and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the setter method `set_name()` to update the value of the `_name` attribute to \"Jane\". Finally, we again use the getter method to retrieve the updated value of the `_name` attribute and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using getter and setter methods allows for controlled access to the attributes of a class, encapsulating the implementation details and providing a consistent interface for interacting with the attributes."

    "When `animal.make_sound()` is called, the `make_sound()` method of the `Animal` class is executed, and \"Animal makes a sound.\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `cat.make_sound()` is called, the `make_sound()` method of the `Cat` class is executed, and \"Meow!\" is printed. This is the overridden behavior.\n",
    "\n",
