    "### 1) In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is raised, it interrupts the normal flow of the program and transfers control to a special block of code known as an exception handler. The exception handler can then take appropriate actions, such as logging the error, displaying an error message, or trying to recover from the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur before the program even starts running. They are caused by incorrect syntax in the code and can be detected by the Python interpreter during the compilation phase. Examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing or mismatched parentheses, and invalid variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The main difference between syntax errors and exceptions is that syntax errors occur during the compilation phase, while exceptions occur during the execution phase. Syntax errors are typically easier to detect and fix because they are caught by the Python interpreter before the program starts running. Exceptions, on the other hand, can be more difficult to detect and handle because they occur during the execution of the program and may be caused by a wide range of factors, such as invalid user input or unexpected system behavior.\n",

    "### In summary, exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are errors that occur during the compilation phase due to incorrect syntax in the code."

    "## 2) When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it results in the program terminating abruptly with an error message. This is known as an \"unhandled exception\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the `input()` function is used to get input from the user, and the `int()` function is used to convert the input to an integer. If the user enters a non-numeric value, a `ValueError` exception will be raised, and the exception handler will print an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the user enters a valid number but it is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` exception will be raised when the program attempts to divide by zero. Since there is no exception handler for this type of exception, the program will terminate abruptly with an error message that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"test.py\", line 3, in <module>\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This error message provides information about the type of exception that was raised (`ZeroDivisionError`), where it occurred (`test.py` on line 3), and the reason for the exception (`division by zero`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's good practice to handle exceptions in your code to prevent unexpected program termination and provide informative error messages to the user."

    "## 3) In Python, you can catch and handle exceptions using the `try-except` statement. The `try` block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the `except` block contains the code that will handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using the `try-except` statement to handle exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

The `try` block then attempts to perform a division operation with the user input, which may raise a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid integer, or a `ZeroDivisionError` if the input is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception occurs, the `try` block will terminate and the program will jump to the appropriate `except` block. In this example, if a `ValueError` is raised, the message `\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\"` will be printed. If a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised, the message `\"Cannot divide by zero.\"` will be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can also use a single `except` block to catch multiple types of exceptions, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",

    "except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a non-zero number.\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 4)In Python, `try-except-else`, `raise`, and `finally` are used to handle exceptions and control the flow of a program. Here's an explanation of each of these statements with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `try-except-else`:\n",
    "The `try-except-else` statement is used to handle exceptions and execute a block of code if no exceptions occur. The `else` block is executed only if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the `try` block attempts to perform a division operation with the user input, which may raise a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid integer, or a `ZeroDivisionError` if the input is zero. If an exception occurs, the appropriate `except` block will be executed. If no exceptions occur, the `else` block will be executed, and the result of the division operation will be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `raise`:\n",
    "The `raise` statement is used to manually raise an exception. This can be useful for creating custom exceptions or for handling exceptional cases in your code. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the `divide()` function takes two arguments and performs a division operation. If the second argument is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised with a custom error message. The `try` block then calls the `divide()` function with arguments that will cause an exception to be raised. The `except` block catches the `ZeroDivisionError` exception and prints the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `finally`:\n",
    "The `finally` statement is used to execute a block of code after the `try` and `except` blocks, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This can be useful for performing cleanup operations, such as closing files or database connections. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = None\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    data = file.read()\n",
    "    print(data)\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    if file:\n",
    "        file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the `try` block attempts to open a file and read its contents. If the file is not found, a `FileNotFoundError` exception is raised. The `finally` block ensures that the file is closed, whether or not an exception was raised."

    "### 5)Custom exceptions in Python are used to provide a more descriptive error message when a specific error occurs in a program. They allow you to create your own exception types, which can make your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can create a custom exception by subclassing an existing exception class or the `Exception` class itself. Here's an example:\n",

    "```\n",

    "Some common types of custom exceptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ValueError`: This exception is raised when a function or method receives an argument with an inappropriate value. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    # rest of the function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `TypeError`: This exception is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class InvalidArgumentError(TypeError):\n",
    "    pass\n",

    "        raise InvalidArgumentError(\"Arguments must be numeric.\")\n",
    "    return a * b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `IOError`: This exception is raised when an input/output operation fails. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FileReadError(IOError):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def read_file(filename):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open(filename, \"r\") as file:\n",
    "            data = file.read()\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        raise FileReadError(f\"File '{filename}' not found.\")\n",
    "    return data\n",
